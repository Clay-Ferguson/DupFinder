"""Generate the installable PNG icon set from the artwork beside this script.

Only needed when the artwork changes; the PNGs it writes are checked in, so
build-deb.sh never has to convert anything (and never needs Pillow).

    uv run --with pillow packaging/icons/make-icons.py

The artwork is `source.png` (or `source.jpeg` / `source.jpg`) in this folder,
ideally square and at least 512 pixels across. A non-square image is cropped
to its centered square. If the art is a rounded-square icon drawn on a
backdrop — as Sonar's render is — set CROP to the icon's outer edge and RADIUS
to its corner radius (both in source pixels), and everything outside is
masked to transparent so it does not show as a tile on a light panel.
